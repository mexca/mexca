    "In this notebook, we will create a new customized component for mexca. All five components in the MEXCA pipeline can be replaced by customized components as long as they have an `apply` method which receives the same input and produces the same output as the standard components.\n",

    "In this example, we will replace the sentiment extraction component with a new component that predicts topic probabilities for each transcribed sentence. For the topic prediction, we use a pretrained [DeBERTa](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.34.1/en/model_doc/deberta#overview) cross-encoder model for natural language inference provided by the SentenceTransformers package on [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/cross-encoder/nli-deberta-base). The model predicts topic probabilities via zero-shot classification which is explained in more detail in this [blog post](https://joeddav.github.io/blog/2020/05/29/ZSL.html). It is implemented in PyTorch using the transformers package.\n",
