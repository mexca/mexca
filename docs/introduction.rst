Introduction
============

The study of human affective behaviour requires capturing emotion expressions in diverse, naturalistic environments (in the *wild*) from different modalities, such as video, audio and text.
Currently, there is a number of commercial and open-source tools which analyse human emotions in video, audio and text.
However, none of these tools is currently capable of combining state-of-the-art, open-source, and free solutions into one single workflow. For this reason, we developed the Multimodal Emotion eXpression Capture Amsterdam (MEXCA) pipeline.

**mexca** is an easy-to-use, customizable Python package implementing the MEXCA pipeline. It is designed for extracting emotion expression features from faces, voices, and speech text in videos.

.. note::
   mexca does not capture experienced emotions, such as "happy" or "sad", but *emotion expressions*. Thus, it does not allow users to make direct inferences about the internal emotional states of persons shown in videos.
   Instead, mexca is intended to study which emotions humans express (more or less intenionally) to the outside world.

The package contains five components that can be used to build the MEXCA pipeline:

- FaceExtractor: Detects faces, encodes them into an embedding space, clusters the embeddings to link reoccuring faces, and extracts facial landmarks and action units.
- SpeakerIdentifier: Performs speaker diarization, that is, detects speech and speech segments, encodes speakers into an embedding space, and clusters the embeddings. Attempts to answer the question: "Who speaks when?".
- VoiceExtractor: Extracts voice features, such as pitch, associated with emotion expressions.
- AudioTranscriber: Transcribes detected speech segments to text.
- SentimentExtractor: Predicts sentiment scores for the transcribed text.

Note that these compents can include several of the building blocks in the pipeline as depicted above. For details on the workflow and the pipeline components, see the :ref:`Features` section.
The modularity of mexca allows users to customize their pipeline and easily add new components (e.g., to use more recent pretrained models).

Intended Use
------------

We strongly suggest to apply mexca only to videos of public persons or persons that have given explicit consent to analysis of their emotion expressions.
We strongly discourage the use of mexca on private videos or for surveillance purposes.
The main intended use case for mexca is (open) research.
